# Setup HTTPS and Certificates
To enable HTTPS, You must have a **Certificate** and **Private Key**.  
Move your **Certificate** and **Private Key** into the *"certificates"* folder.
You will need to specify the **full filename** in the *certs.json* file.  
Next you must set **https** to **true** in the *https.json*.

The server will automatically adopt your Certificate and Private Key.
It logs if it is using HTTPS or HTTP.
